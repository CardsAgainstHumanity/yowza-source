                            %p Here is your Official YowzaCoin! Wow! We’re not really sure how to spend this JPEG on the blockchain, but let us know if you figure it out.

                            %p This email serves as the official receipt for your $0.99 payment (or as we like to call it, your “investment”). There’s nowhere to go but up! 🚀🚀🚀
